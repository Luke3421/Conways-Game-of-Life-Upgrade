# Conways-Game-of-Life-Upgrade
Using same base of Conway's game of life but with essentially no for loops to check neighbors


Within this iteration of Conways game of life, it was code that used both my last iterations update function but a new one to see the high performance computing used. 
This allowed us to see the times of how much faster our new update function was still using the same rules as shown below. 


RULES:

If the cell is alive, then it stays alive if it has either 2 or 3 live neighbors. 
If the cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case that it has 3 live neighbors.

This function could also create larger canvases that require intense computation but done at a fast speed.
